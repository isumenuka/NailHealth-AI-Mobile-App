## 🎯 Project Overview

NailHealth AI uses Google's Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF) models to detect serious diseases through nail signs captured via smartphone camera. The app provides instant clinical explanations and disease predictions.

### 🔬 Medical Capabilities

Detects 7 nail conditions indicating systemic diseases:
- **White Nails (Terry's Nails)** → Liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes
- **Blue Nails** → Oxygen deficiency, lung disease, heart failure  
- **Clubbing** → Lung cancer, COPD, heart disease
- **Spoon Nails (Koilonychia)** → Iron deficiency anemia
- **Black Lines** → Melanoma, trauma, endocarditis
- **Psoriasis** → Psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome
- **Onychogryphosis** → Poor circulation, fungal infection
